              "content": "Reserve Bank has, from time to time, prescribed various prudential norms for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) for enhancing their financial soundness and resilience. Some of these prudential norms have been issued with a view to reducing credit concentration risk, reducing exposures to sensitive sectors, and enhancing provisioning requirements for relatively riskier exposures. These norms, inter alia, include the stipulations relating to small value loans, exposure ceilings on housing and real estate loans, and provisioning requirements for investment in Security Receipts (SRs).\n\n2. With a view to rationalizing these norms, and thereby allowing greater operational flexibility to UCBs without diluting the regulatory objectives, the above prudential norms have been reviewed. The revised instructions are given in the following paragraphs."

All other conditions, as well as the timelines and the intermediate targets remain unchanged.
