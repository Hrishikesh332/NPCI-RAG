                            "content": "The Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets dated June 7, 2019, read with the Framework for Compromise Settlements and Technical Write-offs dated June 08, 2023, provides a principle-based resolution framework to the regulated entities (REs) for addressing any stress in borrower accounts. Further, specific frameworks have been provided for REs to restructure exposures affected by natural calamities viz. the Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) Directions, 2018-SCBs dated October 17, 2018; Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities) Directions 2018 – RRBs dated October 17, 2018; Guidelines for Relief Measures by NBFCs in areas affected by Natural Calamities dated July 28, 2016; and Master Circular - Management of Advances – UCBs dated July 25, 2023.\n\n2. Some of the REs may also be involved in implementation of various forms of Debt Relief Schemes (DRS) announced by State Governments that inter alia entail sacrifice/waiver of debt obligations of a targeted segment of borrowers, against fiscal support. If such schemes are announced frequently, incommensurately, or without due consideration to the principles of financial discipline, they would negatively affect credit discipline and in the long run, may be counter-productive to the credit flow to such borrowers. Apart from the broader implications for the credit discipline and moral hazard issues, DRS also raises certain prudential concerns, which include delay in receipt of dues; mismatch between the claims admitted / submitted by the REs and accepted by the concerned Government as per the terms of the scheme; mandatory requirement of fresh credit by the REs, etc.\n\n3. As such, the REs participating as lenders under such DRS shall comply with the guidelines contained in Annex-1, that lay down certain broad principles in this regard. The guidelines shall apply in respect of DRS notified on or after the date of issue of this guideline and shall be without prejudice to the extant guidelines on resolution of stressed assets applicable to the respective REs.\n\n4. In this context, a model operating procedure (MOP) has also been shared with the State Governments (Annex-2) for their consideration while designing and implementing such DRS through a consultative approach, to avoid any non-alignment of expectations of the stakeholders involved, including the Government, lenders, borrowers, etc.\n\n5. In respect of relief measures announced prior to the introduction of these guidelines, any dues pending receipt from Government, for more than 90 days shall attract specific provision of 100%. REs shall take necessary action and actively follow up with the respective Governments for settlement of such dues at the earliest.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi)    Chief General Manager"

Given the broader implications of such DRS for the credit culture, while broad based relief measures can be addressed through pure fiscal support in the form of Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), DRS should be considered only as a measure of last resort when other measures to alleviate financial stress have failed."

                            "content": "A reference is invited to RBI circular DOR.SOG (LEG).REC/64/09.08.024/2023-24 dated January 1, 2024 on the captioned subject. It requires banks, among other things, to undertake an annual review of accounts/ deposits where there are no customer induced transactions for more than a year; segregation in their Core Banking Solution of accounts opened for credit of scholarship amount and/ or Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT)/ Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) under Government Schemes to facilitate credit of DBTs even if such accounts have become inoperative; and take steps to trace the customers of these accounts/ deposits. It also contains operational guidelines for activation of such accounts/ deposits, customer awareness measures such as public awareness and financial literacy campaigns to be undertaken by banks and requires information on the process for activation of such accounts/ deposits to be displayed on the banks’ websites and branches.\n\n2. The Department of Supervision, RBI, recently conducted an analysis, which revealed that the number of inoperative accounts/ unclaimed deposits in several banks was on the higher side vis-a-vis their total deposits as well as in absolute terms. The reasons were attributed to either inactivity for a long time or pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC in such accounts. Reportedly, there were instances of customers facing inconvenience when they approached the bank branches for activation of inoperative accounts including inadvertent errors in customer details such as mismatch in name, etc. It was also observed that a few banks have a large pendency of accounts that are due for updation/ periodic updation of KYC, resulting in such accounts getting frozen for further transactions as per bank’s internal policies.\n\n3. The banks are, therefore, advised to take necessary steps urgently to bring down the number of inoperative/ frozen accounts and make the process of activation of such accounts smoother and hassle free, including by enabling seamless updation of KYC through mobile/internet banking, non-home branches, Video Customer Identification Process, etc. While the accounts of beneficiaries of various Central/ State government schemes like DBT/EBT etc., are required to be segregated to facilitate uninterrupted credit of such DBT/EBT amounts in their accounts, instances have been observed where the accounts of such beneficiaries have been frozen due to other factors such as pending updation/ periodic updation of KYC. Since these accounts mostly pertain to the people from the underprivileged sections of the society, the banks may facilitate the process of activation of accounts by taking an empathetic view in such cases. The banks may also organise special campaigns for facilitating activation of inoperative/ frozen accounts. Besides, the banks may also facilitate Aadhaar updation for customers through the branches providing Aadhaar related services. Instructions have been issued separately to SLBCs to proactively monitor the situation in their respective jurisdictions with a view to minimise customer inconvenience.\n\n4. The progress in reduction of inoperative/ frozen accounts and the special efforts made by the banks in this regard, may be monitored by the Customer Service Committee (CSC) of the Board. In addition, the banks are also advised to report the same on a quarterly basis to the respective Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) through DAKSH portal, starting from the quarter ending December 31, 2024.\n\n5. A copy of this Circular shall also be placed before the CSC of the Board in its next meeting along with a monitorable action plan for ensuring full compliance in this regard.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)    Chief General Manager"

Any contravention committed after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which a similar contravention was previously compounded shall be deemed to be a first contravention.\n\n4.2 No compounding application shall be processed unless the requisite administrative action is completed by the applicant.\n\nExplanation: Administrative action shall mean such action as may be necessary with respect to the transactions involved in such contravention (as per Rule 8(1) of the Compounding Rules, 2024) and shall include such corrective action that shall be undertaken by the applicant to bring the transaction involved in contravention in compliance with applicable provisions of FEMA. An indicative (but not exhaustive) list of such administrative actions include:\n\n(i) Obtaining requisite approvals/ permissions from the Government or Reserve Bank or any other statutory authority concerned, as case may be;\n\n(ii) Unwinding/ reversing the transaction;\n\n(iii) Repatriating the receivables due;\n\n(iv) Compliance with pricing guidelines or submission of valuation certificate;\n\n(v) Compliance with reporting requirements;\n\n(vi) any other such corrective action as may be required\n\n4.3 Contraventions of serious nature viz. transactions suspected of money laundering, terror financing or affecting sovereignty and integrity of the nation or where the contravener fails to pay the sum for which contravention was compounded within the specified period in terms of the compounding order, shall be referred to the DoE for further investigation and necessary action under the Act.\n\n4.4 Further, in terms of the Rule 9 of Compounding Rules, 2024, transactions, in which amount involved is not quantifiable or, attracting provisions of Section 37A of the Act or, where the Adjudicating Authority has already passed an order imposing penalty under section 13 of the Act or where the DoE is of the view that the compounding proceeding relates to a serious contravention suspected of money laundering, terror financing or affecting sovereignty and integrity of the nation, contraventions of such transactions shall not be eligible for compounding by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4.5 Also, in terms of Rule 4(1) of Compounding Rules, 2024, transactions involving contravention of Section 3(a) of the Act shall not be eligible for compounding by the Reserve Bank.\n\n4.6 It is clarified that whenever a contravention is identified by the Reserve Bank or brought to its notice by the person involved in contravention, the Reserve Bank shall examine whether:"

In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents called for within the specified period, the application for compounding shall be liable to be returned.\n\n5.3 The following factors, which are only indicative, shall be taken into consideration for the purpose of passing compounding order and determining amount on payment of which contravention shall be compounded:\n\n5.4 As per provisions under section 13 of FEMA,1999, the compounding amount can be up to three times the sum involved in the contravention. The compounding amount payable is calculated based on guidance note given below. It may, however, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the compounding amount is derived by the compounding authorities in the Reserve Bank. The actual compounding amount payable may sometimes vary, depending on the circumstances of the case considering the factors indicated in the foregoing paragraph.\n\nI. Guidance Note on Computation Matrix\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\nII. The above amounts are presently subject to the following provisos, viz.\n\ni. The compounding amount payable shall not exceed 300% of the sum involved in contravention.\n\nii. In case the sum involved in contravention is less than Rupees one lakh, the total compounding amount payable shall not be more than amount of simple interest @5% p.a. calculated on the sum involved in contravention and for the period of contravention in case of reporting contraventions and @10% p.a. in respect of all other contraventions.\n\niii. In case of paragraph 8 of Schedule I to FEMA 20/2000 RB contraventions, the compounding amount payable will be further graded as under:\n\niv. In cases where it is established that the contravener has made undue gains, the amount thereof may be neutralized to a reasonable extent by adding the same to the compounding amount calculated as per matrix above.\n\nv. If an applicant against whom a compounding order had been passed earlier and applicant didn’t pay the compounding amount as mentioned in such order and reapplies for compounding of contravention relating to the same transaction, the amount calculated as above may be enhanced by 50% of earlier compounding amount subject to sub-para (i) above.\n\nIII. For calculating compounding amount in respect of reporting contraventions under para I.1 of above matrix, the period of contravention may be considered proportionately {(approx. rounded off to next higher month ÷ 12) X amount for 1 year}.

Reserve Bank has recently carried out a review of the adherence to prudential guidelines as well as practices being followed by SEs with regard to loans against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery. The review, as well as the findings of the onsite examination of select SEs by the Reserve Bank, indicate several irregular practices in this activity. The major deficiencies include (i) shortcomings in use of third parties for sourcing and appraisal of loans; (ii) valuation of gold without the presence of the customer; (iii) inadequate due diligence and lack of end use monitoring of gold loans; (iv) lack of transparency during auction of gold ornaments and jewellery on default by the customer; (v) weaknesses in monitoring of LTV; and (vi) incorrect application of risk-weights, etc. The enclosed Annex incorporates further details in this regard.\n\n3. All SEs are, therefore, advised to comprehensively review their policies, processes and practices on gold loans to identify gaps, including those highlighted in this advice, and initiate appropriate remedial measures in a timebound manner. Further, the gold loan portfolio should be closely monitored, especially in the light of significant growth in the portfolio in certain SEs. It should also be ensured that adequate controls are in place over outsourced activities and third-party service providers.\n\n4. Action taken with regard to the above may be informed to the Senior Supervisory Manager (SSM) of Reserve Bank within three months of the date of this circular. Non-compliance with regulatory guidelines in this regard will be viewed seriously and will attract, among other things, supervisory action by RBI.\n\n5. This circular takes immediate effect.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)      Chief General Manager\n\nEncl.: As above"

The e-mandate framework prescribed, inter alia, that the issuer shall send a pre-debit notification to the customer at least 24 hours prior to the actual charge / debit to the account.\n\n2. Reference is also drawn to the Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated June 07, 2024, wherein it was announced that auto-replenishment of balances in FASTag and National Common Mobility Card (NCMC), which are recurring in nature but without any fixed periodicity, would be facilitated under the e-mandate framework.\n\n3. It has been decided to include auto-replenishment of FASTag and NCMC, as and when the balance falls below a threshold set by the customer, under the e-mandate framework. Payments for auto-replenishment, since they are recurring in nature but without any fixed periodicity, will be exempt from the requirement of pre-debit notification.\n\n4. All other instructions provided under the e-mandate framework shall continue to remain applicable.\n\n5.

The Directions envisaged the Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (NBFC-P2P Lending Platform) to act as an intermediary providing online marketplace / platform to the participants involved in peer to peer lending. Accordingly, the Directions had laid down clear guidelines regarding various aspects of functioning of NBFC-P2P Lending Platforms. However, it has been observed that some of these platforms have adopted certain practices which are violative of the said Directions. Such practices include, among others, violation of the prescribed funds transfer mechanism, promoting peer to peer lending as an investment product with features like tenure linked assured minimum returns, providing liquidity options and at times acting like deposit takers and lenders instead of being a platform. Such violations, when observed, have been dealt with bilaterally by the Reserve Bank of India for remediation.\n\n3. In view of the above, it has been decided to elaborate and clarify certain provisions with some modifications for proper implementation of the Directions. The amended provisions of the Directions are enclosed in the Annex to this circular.\n\n4. The amended provisions contained in this circular except item I(f)(ii) of the enclosed Annex shall come into effect immediately. Item I(f)(ii) of the Annex shall be effective from ninety days of the date of this circular.\n\n5. The Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2017 stands modified accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(J.P.

For exposures under this category, which are not classified as standard, the risk weight shall be as per the category ‘Other Assets (Others)’ as indicated at Sr. No. 6(d) of paragraph 6.2 of the Master Direction ibid (which presently is at 100 per cent).\n\n2.

Since the transfer of regulation of HFCs from National Housing Bank (NHB) to Reserve Bank with effect from August 09, 2019, various regulations have been issued treating HFCs as a category of NBFCs. To be consistent with this policy stance and as stated in para 4 of the aforementioned circular, an analysis of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs was undertaken, with an objective of harmonising these regulations, duly considering specialised nature of the HFCs.\n\n3. Accordingly, based on a review of the extant regulations applicable to HFCs prescribed vide Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company – Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2021, it has been decided to issue revised regulations as detailed in the Part A of Annex. As part of the exercise, certain regulations applicable to NBFCs have also been reviewed and revised regulations are detailed in Part B of Annex. The revised regulations shall be applicable with effect from January 01, 2025.\n\n4. The relevant Master Directions – Non-Banking Financial Company – Housing Finance Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2021, Non-Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016 and Master Direction – Reserve Bank of India (Non-Banking Financial Company– Scale Based Regulation) Directions, 2023 are being modified accordingly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(J. P. Sharma)    Chief General Manager"

BC. 60/20.16.056/2014-15 dated January 15, 2015, inter-alia, directing the credit information companies (CICs) and credit institutions (CIs) to keep the credit information collected/maintained by them updated regularly on a monthly basis or at such shorter intervals as mutually agreed upon between the CI and the CIC. Considering the faster turnaround time in credit underwriting through digital processes, it is imperative that the Credit Information Reports (CIRs) provided by CICs reflect a more current information, enabling lenders to make informed credit decisions.\n\n2. Accordingly, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 11 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA, 2005), it is directed that CICs and CIs shall keep the credit information collected/maintained by them updated regularly on a fortnightly basis (i.e., as on 15th and last day of the respective month) or at such shorter intervals as mutually agreed upon between the CI and the CIC. The fortnightly submission of credit information by CIs to CICs shall be ensured within seven (7) calendar days of the relevant reporting fortnight. Further, as directed vide circular DoR.FIN.REC.49/20.16.003/2023-24 dated October 26, 2023, CICs are required to ingest credit information data received from the CIs, as per their data acceptance rules, within seven (7) calendar days of its receipt from the CIs. This is now being revised to five (5) calendar days of its receipt.\n\n3. CICs shall provide a list of CIs which are not adhering to the fortnightly data submission timelines to Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office at half yearly intervals (as on March 31 and September 30 each year) for information and monitoring purposes.\n\n4. These instructions shall be effective from January 1, 2025. However, the CIs and CICs are encouraged to give effect to these instructions as expeditiously as feasible but not later than January 1, 2025.\n\n5. CICs and CIs that contravene or default in adherence to the above directions shall be liable for penal action as per the provisions of CICRA, 2005.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(J. P.

In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the continuation of the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS) for the financial year 2024-25 with the following stipulations:\n\n(i) In order to provide short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. upto an overall limit of ₹3 lakh to farmers through KCC at concessional interest rate during the year 2024-25, it has been decided to provide interest subvention to lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi-urban branches only), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and computerized Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) ceded with Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), on use of their own resources. This interest subvention will be calculated on the loan amount from the date of disbursement/drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year. The applicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the financial year 2024-25 will be as follows:\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\n(ii) An additional interest subvention of 3% per annum will be provided to such of those farmers repaying in time, i.e., from the date of disbursement of the loan/s upto the actual date of repayment or upto the due date fixed by the banks for repayment of such loan/s, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers repaying promptly as above would get short term crop loans and/or short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial year 2024-25. This benefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay their agri loans after one year of availing such loans.\n\n(iii) Interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit of ₹3 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub-limit of ₹2 lakh per farmer in respect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take priority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the residual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned above. (Illustrations)\n\n(iv) In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention under KCC will be available to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months post the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce stored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the crop loan.\n\n(v) To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.\n\n(vi) However, to provide relief to farmers affected due to severe natural calamities, the applicable rate of interest subvention for that year will be made available to banks for first three years/entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on the restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt repayment incentive @3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected farmers. The grant of such benefit in cases of severe natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).\n\n(vii) To ensure hassle-free benefits to farmers under the MISS, Aadhar linkage would continue to be mandatory for availing the above-mentioned short-term loans in 2024-25.\n\n3. Banks are advised to capture the requisite category wise granular data of individual farmer beneficiaries under the scheme and report the same on Kisan Rin Portal (KRP) to settle the audited MISS claims for the year 2024-25.\n\n4. The claims in respect of computerized PACS ceded with SCBs may be uploaded separately by the respective banks, with the certification that interest subvention/prompt repayment incentive is being claimed on loans for which no refinance has been availed from NABARD, duly certified by the banks’ Statutory Auditors, through KRP module.\n\n5. Banks are advised to take necessary action to upload the claims/additional claims duly certified by their Statutory Auditors as true and correct, on KRP module for FY 2024-25 latest by June 30, 2025.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(R.

                            "content": "As you are aware, under the provisions of the respective State Co-operative Societies Acts, or otherwise, on prudential consideration, several co-operative banks have created Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve (BDDR)1. While in some cases, BDDR is created by recognising an expense in the Profit and Loss (P&L) Account, in other cases it is created through appropriations from net profits.\n\n2. In terms of Accounting Standard (AS) 52, all expenses which are recognised in a period should be included in the determination of net profit or loss for the period. Consequently, not recognising the required provisions for Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) as an expense while arriving at the net profit in the P&L Account is not in consonance with extant Accounting Standards. Further, the treatment of BDDR for regulatory capital and reckoning of net NPAs varies across banks and in many cases has been observed to be at variance with regulatory norms.\n\n3. Accordingly, with a view to bringing about uniformity in the treatment of BDDR for prudential purposes, revised instructions on BDDR are being issued, as under:\n\na) With effect from the FY 2024-25, all provisions as per Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms3, whether accounted for under the head “BDDR” or any other head of account, shall be charged as an expense to the P&L account in the accounting period in which they are recognised. The eligibility of such provisions for regulatory capital purposes shall continue to be as defined in the extant guidelines on capital adequacy4.\n\nb) After charging all applicable provisions as per IRACP norms and other extant regulations to the P&L Account, banks may make any appropriations of net profits below the line to BDDR, if required as per the applicable statutes or otherwise.\n\nc) As a one-time measure, with a view to facilitate rectification and smoother transition to an AS compliant approach, the following regulatory treatment is prescribed:\n\n4. Banks should comply with the provisions of the respective State Co-operative Societies Acts / Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 as applicable."

                            "content": "Please refer to Master Circular DOR.CAP.REC.5/09.18.201/2024-25 dated April 01, 2024 on “Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy - Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)”, Master Circular DoR.CRE.REC.71/07.10.002/2023-24 dated January 16, 2024 on “Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions – UCBs”, and circular UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.4/12.05.001/2012-13 dated July 05, 2012 on “Declaration of Dividend by the UCBs”.\n\n2. It is observed that some UCBs have created the Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) through appropriation of profits, with an intent to utilise these balances to pay dividend in future years, when profits are not sufficient or where the bank has posted a net loss. However, extant guidelines on “Declaration of Dividends by UCBs” dated July 05, 2012 ibid prohibit dividend payments from previously accumulated profits or reserves and mandate that dividend can only be paid by the banks from net profit of the current year after making all statutory and other provisions and after adjustment for accumulated losses in full. It is also observed that UCBs have been considering the balances in DEF as part of Tier-II capital.\n\n3. In order to provide a better treatment of these balances for regulatory capital purposes, it has been decided, as a onetime measure, to permit UCBs to transfer the balances in the DEF to general reserves/free reserves. The credit balances in general reserves/free reserves, shall qualify as Tier-I capital as per our Master Circular ibid.\n\n4. Suitable disclosures shall be made of such transfers in the ‘Notes on Accounts’ to the Balance Sheet in terms of Reserve Bank of India (Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures) Directions, 2021 dated August 30, 2021.\n\n5. UCBs shall comply with the provisions of applicable State/ Central Co-operative Acts & bye-laws, and other applicable laws, statutes and regulations."

Consequently, future issuances of Government Securities in these tenors shall not be available for investment under the Fully Accessible Route.

The existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) for UCBs has since been reviewed. Accordingly, the revised framework replacing the SAF, under the nomenclature Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework is contained in the enclosed Annex.\n\n3. The PCA Framework shall be applicable to all UCBs under Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories except UCBs under All Inclusive Directions1. Tier 1 UCBs, though not covered under the PCA Framework as of now, shall be subject to enhanced monitoring under the extant supervisory framework. The exemption of Tier 1 UCBs from the PCA Framework shall be reviewed in due course.\n\n4. The objective of the PCA Framework is to enable supervisory intervention at an appropriate time and require the UCBs to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, to restore their financial health. The PCA Framework does not preclude RBI from taking any other action as it deems fit at any time, in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the Framework.\n\n5. The provisions of the PCA Framework will be effective from April 1, 2025.\n\n6. UCBs which are currently subject to supervisory actions on the basis of circular DOR (PCB).BPD.Cir No.9/12.05.001/2019-20 dated January 6, 2020 referred above will continue to be governed by the restrictions imposed on them. Such UCBs will be considered for an exit from SAF or to be placed under PCA on a case-by-case basis by the Reserve Bank of India.\n\n7. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of your bank in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the office of the Senior Supervisory Manager concerned.\n\n8. With effect from April 1, 2025, instructions contained in this circular shall supersede all earlier instructions issued on SAF.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Tarun Singh)      Chief General Manager\n\nEnclosure: PCA Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks"

The PCA Framework would apply to all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4, based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.\n\nD. Breach of any risk threshold (as detailed under) may result in invocation of PCA.\n\nTable content (embedded table)\n\nE. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Reported/Audited Annual Financial Results and/or the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. However, RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant. Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the PCA Framework, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or in case of serious governance issues. Also, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking any supervisory action other than those indicated in this circular, based on the merits of each case.\n\nF. Exit from PCA and Withdrawal of Restrictions under PCA - Once a bank is placed under PCA, taking the bank out of PCA Framework and/or withdrawal of restrictions imposed under the PCA Framework will be considered: a) if no breaches in risk thresholds in any of the parameters are observed as per four continuous quarterly financial statements, one of which should be Audited Annual Financial Statement (subject to assessment by RBI); and b) based on supervisory comfort of the RBI, including an assessment on sustainable improvement in key financials of the bank.\n\nG.
