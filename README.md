# NPCI-RAG

This project is a LLM-powered Document Intelligence (DI) System that utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Gemini 2.0, Qdrant for vector storage, and Hugging Face embeddings to provide efficient document querying and chatbot capabilities. We have extracted data from 50+ PDFs to sample our knowledge base and fine tuned LLM RAG for operation.


## Tech Stack

**Frontend** - Streamlit

**Backend** - Firebase, Toranado server

**Database** - Firestore

**LLM** - OpenAI GPT 3.5 turbo


## Roadmap

âœ… MVP Development â€“ Extract JSON data, generate embeddings, store in Qdrant, integrate GPT 3,5 turbo.
âœ… Core System â€“ Build Firebase backend, Streamlit UI, optimize RAG pipeline, add structured responses.
âœ… Scaling & Performance â€“ Improve query speed, deploy on GCP/AWS, add monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana).
âœ… Advanced Features â€“ Multi-modal support, user personalization, auto-summarization, enterprise integration.


## Documentation

Our tool enables users to quickly access key insights from large document repositories. By leveraging AI-powered search and retrieval, it transforms complex, unstructured data into meaningful, structured responses.

- Instant Answers: Query the system in natural language and get relevant information within seconds.

- Enhanced Accuracy: Uses AI-powered RAG and vector search to retrieve precise details.

- User-Friendly Chatbot Interface: Easily interact with the system via an intuitive chat experience.

- Scalable & Secure: Built for high performance and secure enterprise deployment.

- Supports Large Datasets: Handles vast amounts of structured and unstructured documents efficiently.
